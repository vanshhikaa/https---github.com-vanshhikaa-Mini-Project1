              <h1>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h1>
              <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>
              <br>
              <img src="C:\xampp\htdocs\project\img\img1.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
              <br>
              <h3>selector</h3>
              <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). 
               To style a different element, change the selector.</p><br>
               <h3>Declaration</h3>
               <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>
               <h3>Properties</h3>
               <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the "p -tag" elements.)
                    In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>
                   <h3>property-value</h3>
                <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. 
                   This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
                   (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>    
       
       
                   
           </div>
          
           <footer style="background-color:gray; height:30px">
       
           </footer>
